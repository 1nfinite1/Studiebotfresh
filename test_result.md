user_problem_statement: Frontend preview receives "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input" when calling some Next.js LLM API routes. We must guarantee that every route always returns JSON with Content-Type: application/json (no empty/HTML), add instrumentation (ok, policy, db_ok), and implement Exam submit flow.

Testing Protocol:
- This file will be updated by testing agents after each run with findings.
- Always run backend tests first using deep_testing_backend_v2.
- Frontend tests are optional and run only after user confirmation.
- Keep changes minimal and incremental; record assumptions and observed issues.

Notes:
- Preview reproduction calls (Learn, Quiz, Grade, Exam Generate/Submit) must all return JSON with keys outlined in the product requirements.
