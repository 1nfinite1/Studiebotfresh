user_problem_statement: Frontend preview receives "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input" when calling some Next.js LLM API routes. We must guarantee that every route always returns JSON with Content-Type: application/json (no empty/HTML), add instrumentation (ok, policy, db_ok), and implement Exam submit flow.

Testing Protocol:
- This file will be updated by testing agents after each run with findings.
- Always run backend tests first using deep_testing_backend_v2.
- Frontend tests are optional and run only after user confirmation.
- Keep changes minimal and incremental; record assumptions and observed issues.

Notes:
- Preview reproduction calls (Learn, Quiz, Grade, Exam Generate/Submit) must all return JSON with keys outlined in the product requirements.

## Backend Testing Results

### Test Run: 2024-09-19 08:10 UTC
**Status: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED**

**Tested Endpoints:**
1. ✅ POST /api/llm/generate-hints - Returns JSON with ok, policy, db_ok fields
2. ✅ POST /api/llm/quiz/generate-question - Returns JSON with ok, policy, db_ok fields  
3. ✅ POST /api/llm/grade-quiz - Returns JSON with ok, policy, db_ok fields
4. ✅ POST /api/llm/exam/generate - Returns JSON with ok, policy, db_ok fields, generates exam_id
5. ✅ POST /api/llm/exam/submit - Returns JSON with ok, policy, db_ok fields, processes exam submission
6. ✅ Invalid JSON handling - Gracefully handles malformed JSON with 200 status and valid JSON response

**Key Findings:**
- All endpoints now properly return JSON responses with required instrumentation fields (ok, policy, db_ok)
- Content-Type headers are correctly set to application/json
- LLM is not configured (LLM_ENABLED=false), so all responses are stub responses with db_ok=false
- Exam flow is fully implemented: generate creates exam_id, submit processes answers and returns grading results
- Invalid JSON is handled gracefully by Next.js routes (returns 200 with empty object fallback)
- Frontend rebuild was required to include latest route changes

**Technical Notes:**
- Next.js app runs on localhost:3000 with API routes under /api/llm/*
- Backend FastAPI service runs on localhost:8001 but is separate from Next.js API routes
- All routes use `.catch(() => ({}))` pattern for graceful JSON parsing error handling
- Exam storage uses in-memory store with UUID-based exam_id generation

**Resolution:**
The original issue "Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input" has been resolved. All API routes now consistently return valid JSON responses with proper Content-Type headers and required instrumentation fields.

### Test Run: 2024-09-19 08:30 UTC - Materials Upload Routes
**Status: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED**

**Tested Endpoints:**
1. ✅ POST /api/materials/upload - Multipart upload with small PDF (1KB) returns JSON 200 with ok=true, db_ok=true, storage.driver=gridfs, file/material metadata
2. ✅ POST /api/materials/upload - Wrong Content-Type (application/json) returns 400 JSON with ok=false, db_ok=false
3. ✅ POST /api/materials/upload - Oversize file (>15MB) returns 413 JSON with ok=false, db_ok=false
4. ✅ POST /api/upload - Alias route works identically to /api/materials/upload
5. ✅ GET /api/materials/upload - Non-POST method returns 405 JSON with ok=false

**Key Findings:**
- All upload endpoints properly return JSON responses with required instrumentation fields (ok, policy, db_ok)
- Content-Type headers are correctly set to application/json for all responses
- Multipart file upload validation works correctly (Content-Type, file size limits)
- GridFS storage integration is functional with MongoDB connection
- File metadata and material records are properly created in database
- Error handling returns appropriate HTTP status codes with consistent JSON structure
- Both primary route (/api/materials/upload) and alias route (/api/upload) function identically

**Technical Notes:**
- MongoDB connection required MONGODB_URI environment variable set to "mongodb://localhost:27017/studiebot"
- GridFS is used for file storage with metadata stored in materials collection
- File size limit enforced at 15MB (15 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
- Only PDF files (application/pdf) are accepted
- Material IDs generated using UUID format: mat_[uuid]
- Frontend service restart and rebuild required to pick up new API routes

**Database Integration:**
- MongoDB running on localhost:27017
- Database: studiebot
- Collections: materials (metadata), uploads.files and uploads.chunks (GridFS)
- All database operations successful with db_ok=true in responses
